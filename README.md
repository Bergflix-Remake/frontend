## Bergflix is back!

⌛ After being discontinued on the 28th July 2021, Bergflix is back with a new website and a new API. We are currently just two people instead of the 8 that worked on the original project, but oh well. \
We decided to start completely from scratch, with a brand new techstack and design.

## Live and Developement version

🌱 The project is currently in a very early stage in developement, so there is no hosted version yet. You can still download the latest build artifacts from the [Actions page](https://github.com/Bergflix-Remake/frontend/actions).
